#Of Glass And Steel - Devlog

Upon getting back to it after a 2-months break, I reconsidered all
 of my programming projects, and figured this one could work. So I
 had to give it a fair attempt.\
It's quite a commitment, but I want to succeed in my creative
 endeavours at some point. Now is my chance to give it a go.\
I'm emptying OGNS' repo and starting anew, using the SDL library
 this time.
