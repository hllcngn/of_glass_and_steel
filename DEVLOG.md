# Of Glass And Steel - Devlog
### Friday, April 26, 11:16pm
Upon getting back to it after a 2-months break, I reconsidered all
 of my programming projects, and figured this one could work. So I
 had to give it a fair attempt.\
It's quite a commitment, but I want to succeed in my creative
 endeavours at some point. Now is my chance to give it a go.\
I'm emptying OGNS' repo and starting anew, using the SDL library
 this time.\
I'm chosing this over an engine because I just have to do it all
 myself - I don't want to have black boxes of functionalities I
 don't understand the implementation of everywhere, I don't want to
 get clumsy with them, and I don't want an oversized, slow or
 complicated program at the end.\
Once I have a good basis, I'll find an artist to work with me on
 the project.\
