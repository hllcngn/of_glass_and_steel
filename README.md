# of_glass_and_steel (A tale of modernity) - A roguelike

## Ludum Dare #54
I decided to try to make a demo of the game during the Ludum Dare game jam.\
We'll see how that goes...

### usage
```
cd lu...
make
./a
```

### controls
**d** : debug

---
## -WIP-
Not recognizably a game right now.

### usage
```
cd sky...
make
./a
```

### controls
**wasdqezx** : move\
**ESC** : quit

### known issues
- Some terminal don't support the A_DIM ncurses attribute.
- The config files are fucked up!
