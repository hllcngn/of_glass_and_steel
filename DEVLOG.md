# Of Glass And Steel - Devlog
### Friday, April 26, 11:16pm
Upon getting back to it after a 2-months break, I reconsidered all
 of my programming projects, and figured this one could work. So I
 had to give it a fair attempt.\
It's quite a commitment, but I want to succeed in my creative
 endeavours at some point. Now is my chance to give it a go.\
I'm emptying OGNS' repo and starting anew, using the SDL library
 this time.\
I'm chosing this over an engine because I just have to do it all
 myself - I don't want to have black boxes of functionalities I
 don't understand the implementation of everywhere, I don't want to
 get clumsy with them, and I don't want an oversized, slow or
 complicated program at the end.\
Once I have a good basis, I'll find an artist to work with me on
 the project.\
**23:54:** Hello world\
**01:59:** First set of 4-7 test tiles\
The graphics seem to have to be small in order to fit a full map in
 a decently sized window, or to make a 15' fullscreen challenging.\
**04:39:** Basic resizable title menu displaying\
I was too excited to sleep.\
**06:43:** I couldn't sleep at all\
**08:49:** Polishing the title menu\
**17:09:** I could sleep 3h\
Start of complexity: moved the title menu business to its own files.
 I need to refactor the code in order to create more menus.

**22:19:** I've been thinking about making the menus correctly or
 just skipping that part in order to make a fast prototype. I was
 rather distressed about the matter, also recovering from having
 skipped a night of sleep. Decided I'm capable of making those
 menus, so I'll go for making them. We'll see where it takes me.\
I know that it doesn't make much sense in theory - and it's boring
 to make. In my idea, I want to implement the game linearly so that
 I don't miss anything, no part gets overlooked and brings problems
 later, or implementing the missing parts turns into a headache
 because the program has no room for them. I don't want my early
 game to look like a mess or be impenetrable in how it works if I
 can get it tested by alphas also.\
I'm also coincidentally not doing very well these days.\
